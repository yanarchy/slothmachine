# Espresso Bar Sloth Machine

### What will you be having today?

Press the button and try your luck!

### Ok, I notice how it says sloth but you asked for slot.
I may have typo-ed. BUT, I think it was meant to be. No caffeine in the morning makes many people a sloth for the rest of the day!

Thus, sloth slot machine.

### Notes

Works fine with Chrome < 41.0.2 and Firefox < 36.0.4.
If I had more time, I would have used CSS3 so that this would be more cross-browser friendly.

I decided to create image ribbons with a 'blur' effect because it made the animation look faster without it actually being faster. The faster the animation, the slower it performs and it also just doesn't look as smooth.

### Built with:
