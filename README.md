# Espresso Bar Sloth Machine

### What will you be having today?

Press the button and try your luck!

### Ok, I notice how it says sloth but you asked for slot.
I may have typo-ed. BUT, I think it was meant to be. No caffeine for most people makes them a sloth!

Sloth slot machine.

### Notes

This is only optimized for Chrome and only if the width of the window is >1100px. 

If I had more time, I would have used CSS3 so that this would be more cross-browser friendly.

I decided to create image ribbons with a 'blur' effect because it made the animation look faster without it actually being faster. The faster the animation, the slower it performs and it also just doesn't look as smooth.
