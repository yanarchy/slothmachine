# Espresso Bar Sloth Machine

### What will you be having today?

Press the button and try your luck!

### Ok, I notice how it says sloth but you asked for slot.
I may have typo-ed. BUT, I think it was meant to be. No caffeine in the morning makes many people a sloth for the rest of the day!

Thus, sloth slot machine.

### Notes

Works fine with Chrome < 41.0.2 and Firefox < 36.0.4.
If I had more time, I would have used CSS3 so that this would be more cross-browser friendly.

I decided to create image ribbons with a 'blur' effect because it made the animation look faster without it actually being faster. The faster the animation, the slower it performs and it also just doesn't look as smooth.

There are a few ways that I could have implemented the slot machine effect. I chose to use Spritely and have 'blur' image-columns because having separate pictures may cause the browser to slow down and also, the animation effect looks choppy after a certain speed. The blurred images make it look like it's much faster than it is.
